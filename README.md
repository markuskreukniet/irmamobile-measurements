# irmamobile-measurements



The file /lib/src/screens/scanner/scanner_screen.dart has a few static IP-adresses, which we should change to a IP-adres of a active and configured IRMA server. An example of such a static IP-adress is: sp.u = "http://141.138.142.35:8088/irma/session/F6S2w69mpyX8ABOHbTtO";
